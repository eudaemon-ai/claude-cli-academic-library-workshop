At each step, you&#39;ll also examine Claude&#39;s outputs critically—learning to spot where AI assistance helps and where it needs your expertise to catch errors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>What You&#39;ll Learn\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>How to verify Claude understands cataloging standards before generating records\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How \u003Ccode>claude --help\u003C/code> and \u003Ccode>/help\u003C/code> differ — CLI launch flags versus in-session commands\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to use \u003Ccode>claude --print\u003C/code> for quick standards lookups without opening a full session\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to pass catalog item files to Claude using \u003Ccode>@\u003C/code> references\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to generate MARC 21 records with proper RDA descriptive standards\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to ask Claude to identify its own uncertain fields before you verify them\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to use Claude Code&#39;s file-writing capability to save draft records\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to generate LCSH subject headings for multiple items and compare approaches\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to write catalog-register abstracts (MARC 520/521) and archival scope notes\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2>Before You Begin\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Make sure Claude Code is installed on your machine.
