════════════════════════════════════════════
BUDGET CONTEXT (narrative only — no dollar figures)
════════════════════════════════════════════

Collections represent the single largest budget line, followed by personnel. The collections
budget has remained flat for three consecutive years while vendor price increases have
averaged 5–7% annually, creating a structural gap that has required journal cancellations
in two consecutive review cycles.

The library has no dedicated capital budget for space renovation. Any facility work
requires a formal request to the Provost's office and competes with university-wide
deferred maintenance priorities.

Grant funding: The library currently holds one active grant (digital preservation
infrastructure) ending in the next fiscal year. Two new grant applications are in
development (open educational resources program; community digitization initiative).

════════════════════════════════════════════
KEY INSTITUTIONAL STAKEHOLDERS
════════════════════════════════════════════

Provost:           Direct supervisor of Dean of Libraries. Priorities: research growth,
                   accreditation readiness, enrollment-linked outcomes.

Faculty Senate     Reviews collection decisions, advises on research support priorities.
Library Committee: Meets twice per semester. Values faculty voice in selection policy.

Student Government Advocates for student access: hours, reserves, study space.
Library Liaison:   Communicates directly with Dean.

Academic Depts:    Subject librarians maintain liaison relationships. Engineering,
                   Nursing, and Business are highest-demand instruction partners.

University IT:     Joint responsibility for library systems (ILS, discovery layer,
                   A/V equipment). Relationship is collaborative but requires advance
                   coordination for any platform changes.
