Each document type has a distinct register, a specific audience, and professional risks if it gets the tone wrong.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Claude Code can act as a first-draft partner for all of these — faster and more malleable than starting from a blank page. But the judgment calls that make these documents defensible remain entirely yours: which findings matter, what commitments you&#39;re willing to make, and how much uncertainty to disclose to which audience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This module assumes you are in a director, dean, or senior administrator role.
